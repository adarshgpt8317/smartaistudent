  <p>
    Many students fear that Artificial Intelligence will replace them.
    Others believe AI will do everything for them.
    Both groups are wrong.
  </p>

  <p>
    AI will not replace students.
    It will replace students who avoid effort,
    responsibility, and learning.
  </p>

  <h2>Why the Fear Around AI Is Misplaced</h2>
  <p>
    Throughout history, new tools have always scared people.
    Calculators, computers, and the internet all created fear.
    None of them replaced learning.
  </p>

  <p>
    AI works the same way.
    It changes how work is done,
    not whether thinking is required.
  </p>

  <h2>Who AI Actually Replaces</h2>
  <p>
    AI replaces tasks that are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Repetitive</li>
    <li>Mindless</li>
    <li>Copied without understanding</li>
    <li>Done without judgment</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Students who only memorize,
    copy answers, or avoid thinking
    are the first to become irrelevant.
  </p>

  <h2>The Difference Between Smart and Lazy AI Usage</h2>

  <h3>Lazy usage looks like this:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Copying AI answers directly</li>
    <li>Submitting AI work without review</li>
    <li>Using AI to escape learning</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This behaviour leads to poor understanding
    and long-term failure.
  </p>

  <h3>Smart usage looks like this:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Using AI to clarify concepts</li>
    <li>Checking and improving AI output</li>
    <li>Learning faster, not skipping learning</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    AI amplifies effort.
    It does not replace it.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Responsible Students Benefit the Most</h2>
  <p>
    Students who already try to understand concepts
    use AI as a force multiplier.
  </p>

  <p>
    They:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Learn faster</li>
    <li>Practice better</li>
    <li>Make fewer mistakes</li>
    <li>Adapt quickly</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    AI gives these students an advantage,
    not a replacement.
  </p>

  <h2>The Role of Thinking in an AI World</h2>
  <p>
    AI does not decide what matters.
    Humans do.
  </p>

  <p>
    Decision-making, judgment, and context
    remain human responsibilities.
    Students who stop thinking
    because AI exists
    lose relevance.
  </p>

  <h2>Who Should Be Worried About AI</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Students who rely only on copying</li>
    <li>Students who avoid fundamentals</li>
    <li>Students who reject responsibility</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    AI exposes weakness.
    It does not hide it.
  </p>

  <h2>What Students Should Do Instead</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Learn how to ask better questions</li>
    <li>Understand AI outputs before using them</li>
    <li>Use AI to improve, not escape work</li>
    <li>Accept that effort is still required</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Final Verdict</h2>
  <p>
    AI is not an enemy of students.
    It is a filter.
  </p>

  <p>
    Students who think, adapt, and take responsibility
    will grow faster than ever.
    Students who avoid effort
    will be replaced first.
